# Tabel Installer - Get going ASAP!
Tabel is a all in one, PC Setup thing. It sets up everything for you when you get a new pc. (Currently only supported on Debian/Ubuntu and Arch base systems, but I might port it over to windows once [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) get's good enough.

Tabel was first written in Bash, but I'm currently learning python so I wanted to migrate everything over to python. Currently the project is still a work-in-progress and probably always will as my skills improve in python I will keep adding more features. 

Features
- Super easy to use.
