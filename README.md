# Tabel Installer - Get going ASAP!
Tabel is a all in one, linux setup tool. Tabel will download all the basic packages needed for a usable system including wine, fonts and more. A full list will be avaiable soon. 

### Support
Currently tabel is supported on **Fedora, Arch and Debian/Ubuntu distros.**

Tabel is written in plain old bash to make it easy to fork and add changes you deem necessary for your setup. Currently the project is still a work-in-progress and is **not production ready, DO NOT USE IT YET!** 

Features
- Super easy to use.
- Only the essentials and nothing else. 
- More soon!
