### About Tabel
Tabel is written in plain **old bash** to make it easy to fork and add changes you deem necessary for your own setup. Currently the project is still a work-in-progress and is **not production ready, DO NOT USE IT YET!** But if like to live a risky life, you're free to give it a try and report any issues you experienced :D
